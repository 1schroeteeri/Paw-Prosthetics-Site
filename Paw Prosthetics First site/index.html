    <!-- NAV BAR: Took a long time to make due to issues with the above links to bootstrap. Refreshing them and using new links seems to have solved the problem and allowed for the navbar to function both as it's default and as my customized version. Attempts to code it in HTML were also failing to get the look I liked, so I ended up using bootstrap styling and customizing in CSS... Setup in Bootstrap built off of logic learned from this https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_navbar.asp and this https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/ a few videos were also watched but both were of low quality and didn't actually yield results. Ultimately this link also proved useful for making some smaller adjustments to the way my nav was laid out to get it to collapse easier-->
